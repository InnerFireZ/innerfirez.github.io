It is a Python-based system that monitors torrent peers (focused on Bulgarian IP addresses), enriches them with multiple threat-intelligence sources, and visualizes the results on a live map and analytics dashboards.\nThe idea came to me because I wanted to see—at least roughly—how many people in Bulgaria (where I’m from) are interested in cybersecurity. It’s one of those topics that not many people like to talk about, and some even prefer to keep it secret. My goal was simply to count how many of them are downloading specialized operating systems built for the cybersecurity field. These torrents are obviously not something your grandma would download (unless she’s an old hacker 😄); they are mostly downloaded by people working or learning in this field.\nHowever, I quickly ran into a problem. There are a lot of bots, proxies, mobile devices, and shared public IPs everywhere. Because of this, I needed a way to verify what types of devices were actually behind the IP addresses(but using only open source data).\nAt the same time, I also wanted to see how many of these devices were malicious. Many beginners in this field don’t understand the importance of using a VPN, for example, and they sometimes attack other systems directly from their home IP address. This project helped me test whether that assumption is true. Also, many of them are downloaded by using VPS to perform attacks too.\nTo achieve this, I searched for the best free API providers that could help with IP and threat-intelligence data. With the additional help of AI to write fast and almost perfect Python code, the idea became reality.\nIn the screenshots below, I will show how much data I collected in just one month and some of the interesting things I discovered from this activity.\nIt is built to run continuously, store historical context, and generate practical signals you can act on.\nWhat This Project Does Monitors torrent (Kali,Parrot and other custom ones) peers and extracts IPs from specific geolocation in this case Bulgaria. Enriches IPs via multiple threat intel APIs. Correlates signals into risk levels and attacker classification. Visualizes results on a Folium map with filters and HUD controls. Provides stats, analytics, and reports for deeper analysis. Abstract IP Intelligence integration with full response storage and security flag stats.
